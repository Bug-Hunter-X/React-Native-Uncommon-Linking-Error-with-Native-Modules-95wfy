# React Native Uncommon Linking Error with Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky error in React Native development related to linking native modules.  The error manifests when a third-party library requiring native code isn't correctly linked to your React Native application. This typically leads to runtime crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The example showcases a scenario where an attempt to use a hypothetical native module (`MyNativeModule`) fails because of an incomplete or incorrect linking process.  The error may appear as a cryptic runtime exception or a missing module error.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying the linking steps specific to the native module in use.  This might include using tools like `react-native link` (if supported by the library), manually linking the native code to your Android and iOS projects, or ensuring all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run the app. You'll encounter the linking error.
4. Refer to the `RNLinkingErrorSolution.js` file to see how to fix the issue based on the library's specific linking instructions.  Generally, this involves verifying the linking steps in your Android and iOS project files.

## Key Learning Points
- Always double-check native module linking instructions. 
- Pay attention to the specific error messages provided by React Native.
- Consult the documentation of the library that you're using. 
- Use a debugger to identify which native module is causing the linking issue.
