This error occurs when using a library or component that hasn't been correctly linked or configured within your React Native project. This often happens with native modules that require specific setup steps.  For example, you might encounter this if you're using a third-party library that needs to be linked to your project but the linking process wasn't completed successfully.  Another example is when you are trying to use an iOS feature or Android feature without adding the necessary libraries or modules.
